The first thing is to find out do you have gcc and g++ installed in your Ubuntu, you can use
$ which g++ && which gcc
to find out.
If there is nothing please install them.
$ sudo apt-get install gcc && apt-get install g++
After the installation, you can check by use the which command above to find out the path of your gcc & g++.
Then turn on your Eclipse, go to Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Build -> Settings -> Discovery -> CDT GCC Build in Complier Settings [Shared]
Change from : ${COMMAND} -E -P -v -dD "${INPUTS}"
          to: /usr/bin/${COMMAND} -E -P -v -dD "${INPUTS}"

I hope this may help.
